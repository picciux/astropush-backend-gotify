If you need help setting up Gotify service on your system:

1. Download Gotify binary for your platform from [Gotify site](https://gotify.net), in *Download* section.
2. Unzip the archive, and copy the gotifi binary to `/usr/bin/gotify`
3. Launch `install.sh` script in this directory.
4. Gotify should be up and running: check it pointing browser to [Gotify service](http://localhost:8627). Username and password are both "astropush".
5. If everything is ok, you can install Gotify backend with `install.sh` script in parent directory. When asked for Gotify api url, insert: `http://localhost:8627`
6. You're done!
