Description: Simple push notification abstraction layer for Kstars/Ekos.
 Astropush is writenn with robotic astronomic observatory in mind:
 it provides an abstraction layer between KStars notification system,
 and one of many push notification transports (from simple email to the
 most fancy paid notification service).
 .
 This backend uses Gotify server (https://gotify.net) to relay
 Astropush notifications.
