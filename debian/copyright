 This is the Linux-penguin again...
 .
 Originally drewn by Larry Ewing (http://www.isc.tamu.edu/~lewing/)
 (with the GIMP) the Linux Logo has been vectorized by me (Simon Budig,
 http://www.home.unix-ag.org/simon/).
 .
 This happened quite some time ago with Corel Draw 4. But luckily
 meanwhile there are tools available to handle vector graphics with
 Linux. Bernhard Herzog (bernhard@users.sourceforge.net) deserves kudos
 for creating Sketch (http://sketch.sourceforge.net), a powerful free
 tool for creating vector graphics. He converted the Corel Draw file to
 the Sketch native format. Since I am unable to maintain the Corel Draw
 file any longer, the Sketch version now is the "official" one.
 .
 Anja Gerwinski (anja@gerwinski.de) has created an alternate version of
 the penguin (penguin-variant.sk) with a thinner mouth line and slightly
 altered gradients. It also features a nifty drop shadow.
 .
 The third bird (penguin-flat.sk) is a version reduced to three colors
 (black/white/yellow) for e.g. silk screen printing. I made this version
 for a mug, available at the friendly folks at
 http://www.kernelconcepts.de/ - they do good stuff, mail Petra
 (pinguin@kernelconcepts.de) if you need something special or don't
 understand the german  :-)
 .
 These drawings are copyrighted by Larry Ewing and Simon Budig
 (penguin-variant.sk also by Anja Gerwinski), redistribution is free but
 has to include this README/Copyright notice.
 .
 The use of these drawings is free. However I am happy about a sample of
 your mug/t-shirt/whatever with this penguin on it...
